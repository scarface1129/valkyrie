# valkyrie
## A python Django Project (First Python project using django)


Valkyrie is an application which is inform of a blog although not yet completed but has the functionality of impacting some needed knowledge to newbies in the tech space.
The application divides the activities in the tech space into two broad parts which is the coding and non coding aspects of tech, from each branch you will get many other
stacks. 

The application also gives the requirements needed in learning a stack and also a perfect road map to it. Most newbies waste most of their time learning the wrong thing 
due to the fact that they dont actually know the perfect and required path to follow but this application has solved such problem.

What drived the production of such web application, was the experience i had when i came into the tech space, i was confused on the stacks and the road map to follow in
other to archieve what i wanted. this application solves such problem now.

## How to use application

When user first gets into the application they see the two different branches of Tech which is the Coding and the Non-coding parts of tech then the journey starts from
anywhere they click.

Another aspect of the application is that users by permission are able to post anything about a particular stack based on providing needed information about that stack
the post is created and submitted to be verified by the admin before being posted for the public view.

User posts can be blocked or suspended.

A user when registered will also be verified by the admin before they can start posting on the application, and when a user is blocked, then all the posts made by that
particuular user is also suspended.
